    Community Creativity for Development (<a class="text-decoration-none text-primary" href="https://asknet.community/hubs/cc4d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CC4D</a>) is a Youth-led community-based organization formed in August 2019 by a group of South Sudanese Refugee Youth professionals who saw a gap in repair, reuse and maintenance of Electronics with its headquarters in Eden II, Rhino Camp. CC4D aims at connecting communities while also finding solutions to protect the environment from global warming. We connect communities through organizing repair caf√© events that encourage people to work together and share knowledge and skills which helps to bring people together and work on building a more coherent and peaceful community.
